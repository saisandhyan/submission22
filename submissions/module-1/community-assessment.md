	I am from Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh , India and i am pursing my BTech 3rd year in Computer Science and Engineering.
My hobbies are Playing chess,Drawing, sketching, painting, playing sports(Throwball,badminton etc.) and Travelling.
 	I am a certified Android NanoDegree developer certified by UDACITY.I am very much interested i organising an event and till now i organised some events under our community and in that the one event is a National level event named TECHRITZ 2020 and now i am going to conduct the National wide Hackathon in collaboration with MLH(Major League Hacking)which is created by the Microsoft and Github for the students benefits and i even participated in Hackathons which are conducted for 24hours and also for 48hours hackathon and in the 48hours hackathon i was placed 4th and i am doing many mini projects in android and flutter ad also i am also designing some websites like "www.techritz2020.com" and "vinspiron.tech".and i am exploring my life in many aspects.
 	I am very much interested in building the communities because after my completion of the Android nanodegree developer course i want to share my knowledge with my friends but that is impossible to share about my hole course and to explain them it will be like only some persons will be taken my knowledge but there are lot many persons who are interested in learing new things and they are waiting for that opportunity to share in a equal way and what ever news is there and that is very important that was been not shared with all equally so at that point me and my friends together decided that why don't we start a community and that community should be helpful to everyone and that should see all the students in one level only and there should not be any wars and all the matters should be shared with everyone equally and because of the community we are learning many things and we are building our futures by helping eachother in our college and we are also including the other colleg students also and we are utilizing this and we are solving a problems easily than before and the time to solve is also decreased.Because of creating this we are learning all the domains needed easily.
